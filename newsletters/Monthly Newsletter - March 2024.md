# Monthly Newsletter

## March 2024

Sorry For the late newsletter we were working on the March Update for Ram Networks (Logo, flash games, etc.)
But, We've done it, we made a March Theme for Ram Networks! 
The amount of effort put in for this update is immeasurable. So thanks for the help and input of my friends and Co-Workers!
but, I'm gonna be honest this last update was A LOT I had to make a New logo, Code for fullscreen/about:blank cloaking, code to embed flash games (Chatgpt has saved me again), 
and a theme for the site. PLUS we are working on this new GitHub repo!

I'm truly so proud of what we made this month and what we've done from, the new theme, to new partnership, all is well.

Sorry for the short newsletter, Yesn't
